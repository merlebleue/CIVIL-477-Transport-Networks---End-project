\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Problem Statement}

To evaluate the impact of introducing a light rail network and park-and-ride (P\&R) facilities, we analyze road link usage under three scenarios:
\begin{description}
    \item[1. Base] No light rail is present; all trips are made by road.
    \item[2. Light Rail] The light rail can only be used if both the origin and destination are served by the network, with no transfers between modes allowed.
    \item[3. P\&R] The light rail can be used if either the origin or the destination is served by the network, representing the effect of park-and-ride facilities at stations.
\end{description}

We use the simplified Sioux Falls network as a case study. This network is widely used as a benchmark in traffic engineering due to its manageable size and typical grid structure, which allows for efficient computation and clear interpretation of results. Figure \ref{fig:casestudy} shows the road network and the origin-destination (OD) demand used in our analysis. The demand data is taken from the course assignment; while the exact units are not specified, we assume the values represent thousands of users.

\subsection{Defining the Light Rail Lines}

To define the light rail lines, we mapped the current Sioux Falls bus lines onto the simplified road network (see Figure \ref{fig:mapping_bus}). We then compared this network with the most heavily used links at user equilibrium in the base scenario to generate two candidate light rail lines (see Figure \ref{fig:light_rail_network}).

\end{figure}

Travel times for the light rail were estimated based on node-to-node distances measured on Google Maps. A speed of 25 miles per hour was used, reflecting average light rail speeds in the US\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_rail\#Speed_and_stop_frequency}}. Individual link travel times are provided in Appendix \ref{sec:tram_travel_times}.

\subsection{Assumptions}

The following simplifying assumptions are made:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each traveler can only use one P\&R facility (i.e., they have one car, which cannot be taken on public transport).
    \item The costs of using the light rail for part of the trip (waiting time, parking, walking, parking fee, etc.) are considered offset by the comfort and fuel savings, so only travel time is considered.
    \item The light rail is completely independent of road traffic and has constant travel time.
    \item The light rail has no capacity constraint.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Modeling Traffic}

Road traffic is modeled using a Frank-Wolfe optimization algorithm with the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) formula for travel time:
\begin{equation}
    t(x) = t_0 \times \left [ 1 + \alpha \times \left (\frac{x}{\text{capacity}} \right )^\beta \right ]
\end{equation}
where $\alpha = 0.15$, $\beta = 4$, and $t_0$ and capacity are link-specific.

The travel time on the light rail network is considered constant. Shortest paths are computed using Dijkstra's algorithm, implemented with the Python library \texttt{scipy}. The algorithm stops when the gap in total travel times is smaller than $10^{-4}$.

Adding a light rail network is modeled as a two-layer system (Figure \ref{fig:2layer_0}), with the light rail as an additional layer on top of the road network. In scenario \textbf{2. Light Rail}, the two layers are not connected. For OD pairs eligible to use the light rail, we compute travel times on both layers and assign traffic to the layer with the lowest travel time (Figure \ref{fig:2layer_1}).

    \begin{subfigure}{0.33\textwidth}

        \label{fig:2layer_4}
    \end{subfigure}%
    \caption{Two-layer network}
\end{figure}

In scenario \textbf{3. P\&R}, we add zero-cost connection links between the two layers at stations (Figure \ref{fig:2layer_2}). However, travelers cannot use the tram network in the middle of their trip (see the assumptions). For each all-or-nothing assignment, we consider three graphs (Figure \ref{fig:2layer_3}) :
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Onboarding graph:} Two layers, with links only from the road layer to the tram layer. For OD pairs where the destination is served by a tram station, we compute the shortest path from the origin node on the road layer to the destination node on the tram layer.
    \item \textbf{Offboarding graph:} Two layers, with links only from the tram layer to the road layer. For OD pairs where the origin is served by a tram station, we compute the shortest path from the origin node on the tram layer to the destination node on the road layer.
    \item \textbf{Road graph:} Road network only. We compute the shortest path for all OD pairs.
\end{enumerate}

Depending on the origin-destination pair, we may have computed three different shortest paths. We assign the traffic according to the shortest travel time.
