\section{Results}

This section presents the main results for each scenario, focusing on both graphical and quantitative outcomes. Detailed numerical values are provided in Appendices \ref{sec:flow_road} and \ref{sec:flow_rail}.

\subsection{Base Scenario}

    \label{fig:base_scenario}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:base_scenario} shows the computed traffic flows in the base scenario. Line 1 (nodes 2-3-4-8-9-14-18) follows a path where roads are well used, while line 2 (nodes 12-23-20-21-14-9-15-7-5) mainly serves streets with low to moderate traffic, except for its shared segment with line 1. However, line 2 could also help absorb traffic from adjacent roads.

The \textbf{total travel time} in this scenario is \textbf{74.8 [1000 user $\cdot$ h]}.

\subsection{Light Rail Scenario}

        \label{fig:diff_sc2}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{`Light rail' scenario results}
    \label{fig:lightrail_scenario}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:lightrail_scenario} illustrates the effect of adding two tram lines, without park-and-ride facilities. The \textbf{total travel time} drops to \textbf{43.5 [1000 user $\cdot$ h]}, representing a 40\% improvement over the base scenario. The most heavily used tram links are between nodes 9 and 14 (served by both lines), 21 and 14 (line 2), and 9 and 15 (line 2). Notably, line 2, although not aligned with the highest road traffic, carries the most crowded tram segments. The overlap of both lines on the busiest link is a positive feature for network design.

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:diff_sc2}, the tram network reduces road usage on nearly all links, with the greatest improvements in the central district (nodes 8-9-14-18). Only the link between nodes 3 and 10 sees a slight increase in traffic (less than 1\%). Improvements are also observed on links not directly served by the tram, such as 7-8 and 17-19. This shows that the development of public transport can have a positive impact on congestion throughout the road network, not just in the surroundings of the new public transport.

\subsection{P\&R Scenario}

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{`Park-and-ride' scenario results}
    \label{fig:pnr_scenario}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:pnr_scenario} presents the results for the scenario with park-and-ride facilities at every station. The \textbf{total travel time} is further reduced to \textbf{38.1 [1000 user $\cdot$ h]}, the lowest among all scenarios. The impact is especially strong on central links, with even greater improvements than in the previous scenario. However, some links (e.g., nodes 2-3-4) experience increased traffic despite being served by light rail, due to the light rail not being competitive for those OD pairsâ€”users now drive to node 4 and no longer use the tram for that segment.

    \label{fig:comp_sc23}
\end{figure}

Comparing the addition of a light rail network with or without park-and-ride facilities (Figure \ref{fig:comp_sc23}), we can see an increase in the usage of the tram network in the center of the lines, but a decrease on the peripheral links. With P\&R, the light rail network yields better traffic reduction in the center of the city but has less impact for peripheral nodes. Park-and-ride facilities could therefore replace line extensions, increasing the return on investment and allowing for greater impact with less money. Figure \ref{fig:comp_sc23} is particularly useful for designing effective stations where park-and-ride facilities should be added: we suggest nodes 4, 14, 15, and 21. We also recommend studying a reduced network without tram lines beyond these nodes to reduce overall cost.
