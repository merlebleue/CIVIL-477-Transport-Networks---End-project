\section{Results}

In this section, we present graphical results for each scenario. The numerical values of the results are presented in Appendixes \ref{sec:flow_road} and \ref{sec:flow_rail}.

\subsection{Base scenario}

    \caption{Base scenario trafic}
    \label{fig:base_scenario}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:base_scenario} presents the computed trafic flows in the base scenario. As we can see, line 1  runs along a corridor (nodes 2-3-4-8-9-14-18) with high trafic, while line 2 (nodes 12-23-20-21-14-9-15-7-5) runs on street with small to moderate trafic, except on its shared link with line 1. However, line 2 could take the trafic present on adjacent roads as well.

The \textbf{total travel time} in this scenario is \textbf{74.8 [1000 user $\cdot$ h]}.

\subsection{Light rail scenario}

        \label{fig:diff_sc2}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{`Light rail' scenario results}
    \label{fig:lightrail_scenario}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:lightrail_scenario}, we present the effect of adding the two tram lines to the model, without park-and-ride facilities. The \textbf{total travel time} in this scenario is \textbf{43.5 [1000 user $\cdot$ h]}, a 40\% improvement on the base scenario. As we can see on Figure \ref{fig:tram_sc2}, the three most used tram links are between nodes 9 and 14 (desserved by both lines), between nodes 21 and 14 (on line 2) and between nodes 9 and 15 (also on line 2). As such, even if line 2 wasn't along the most used road links, it is this line that has the most crowded segments. The overlap between the two lines on the most used link is also good point for the design of the tram network.

As we can see in Figure \ref{fig:diff_sc2}, the addition of the tram line reduces road usage on nearly all route links. The route link between node 3 and node 10 is the only one which sees an increase in traffic, but of very limited size (less than 1\%). The best improvements are in the central district, along line 1 (along nodes 8-9-14-18). We also see improvements between nodes 7 and 8 altough those are not desserved directly by a tram line, but also on link 17-19 even though it is not connected to the light rail network. As such, we see that the development of public transport can have positive impact on the congestion in the whole road network and not only in the surrondings of the new public transport.

\subsection{P\&R scenario}

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{`Park-and-ride' scenario results}
    \label{fig:pnr_scenario}
\end{figure}

The results of adding a lightrail network with park-and-ride facilities at each station are shown in Figure \ref{fig:pnr_scenario}. The \textbf{total travel time} in this scenario is \textbf{38.1 [1000 user $\cdot$ h]}, the best of all three scenarii. Additionnally, there is a good impact on most links. The improvement is even better in this scenario than in the previous scenario in the central links. However, some links see an increase in traffic even if they are served by a lightrail line (along nodes 2-3-4). Looking at the precise results in Appendix \ref{sec:flow_road}, we understand this is due to the travel time in the Light Rail not being competitive. Now that the users can take their car up to node 4, there is no more usage of the tram on these links.

    \label{fig:comp_sc23}
\end{figure}

Comparing adding a light rail network with or without Park-and-ride facilities (Figure \ref{fig:comp_sc23}), we can see increase in the usage of the tram network in the center of the lines, but a decrease on the peripheral links. With P\&R, the light rail network yields better trafic reduction in the center of the city but has less impact for peripheral nodes. Park-and-ride facilities could therefore replace line extensions, increasing the return on investment and allowing to do more impact with less money. Figure \ref{fig:comp_sc23} is particularly useful to design usefull stations where to add Park-and-ride facilities : we would suggest nodes 4, 14, 15 and 21. We would also recommand to study a reduced network without tram lines beyond these nodes, to reduce overall cost.
